<p><i>Nelly</i> (<i>throwing brush on lounge</i>). That will do for to-day. It’s time
Carlos were back from the post-office. I am anxious to obtain a letter
from my invisible adorer, Dixon Dolby. How my good brother would open
his eyes if he knew the extent of my wickedness. Three months ago, six
of us girls at school, desirous of acquiring proficiency in
correspondence, agreed to write to gentlemen whom we had never met, but
whom we knew by reputation to be gentlemen. My choice was my brother’s
chum before his marriage, Dixon Dolby. My plan succeeded admirably. He
answered the note signed, Rosa Bean. The most tender and impassioned
epistles followed on both sides, until at last he had the impudence to
request an exchange of photographs. I consented, but was not fool enough
to allow him to discover my identity; so, to secure his, I sent instead
a photograph of my brother’s wife. I knew they had never met, but they
must; and when they do, won’t there be fun. I only hope I shall be at
the <i>denouement</i>. Ah! here’s Carlos.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos</span>, <small>C.</small>, <i>with two letters and a paper</i>.)</p>

<p>Well, Carlos, what success?</p>

<p><i>Carlos</i> (<i>putting letters behind him</i>). Hey? What’ll<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a> you give to know?
Ought to give a feller somethin’ purty sweet, cos I ran all the way.</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Indeed I will, Carlos. My warmest thanks and my sweetest smile.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Is that all? Well, here’s a letter (<i>gives her a letter</i>).</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> O, thank you, Carlos. You’re a dear, good boy (<i>takes letter,
and sits in arm-chair</i>, <small>L.</small>).</p>

<p><i>Carlos</i> (<i>comes down</i> <small>R.</small>, <i>puts newspaper on table</i>). Kinder thought I
might get somethin’ sweeter; a kiss, perhaps. But I s’pose she was
afraid somebody might be lookin’. I wouldn’t a cared if they had. She’s
jest as purty as a pictur; and I kinder think she hankers arter me. I
jest like her, you bet! Wish sometimes I could be a caterpillar, and
crawl under her purty feet. I couldn’t be more smashed than I am now.
Wal, I’ll go and hunt up Mr. Cleverly with the other letter (<i>goes up</i>
<small>C.</small>). Nothin’ wantin’, Miss Nelly?</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Nothing; thank you, Carlos.</p>

<p><i>Carlos</i> (<i>at door</i>). O, she’s a beauty. Takes such pains to call me
Carlos. Mr. Cleverly he always calls me Careless, ’cause he says it’s my
natur. <span class="exunt">[<i>Exit</i></span> <small>C.</small></p>

<p><i>Nelly</i> (<i>takes photograph from letter</i>). There he is; charming fellow.
He has no idea I am the sister of his best friend. Not bad-looking
(<i>holds photograph up</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Cleverly</span> <i>with hat and shawl, door</i> <small>L.</small> <i>She looks over</i>
<span class="smcap">Nelly’s</span> <i>shoulder at picture</i>.)</p>

<p>A girl might be happy with such a man. I’ve no doubt I shall blush when
we meet. (<i>To photograph.</i>) You dear fellow, you are good-looking and
smart&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Indeed he is, Nelly.<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a></p>

<p><i>Nelly</i> (<i>jumping up</i>). O, good gracious! you here?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Have I disturbed your devotions? Who is he? When will it be?</p>

<p><i>Nelly</i> (<i>puts photograph in her bosom</i>). Nonsense; it’s only a slight
acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> You do not slight his picture. I should say he was a
bosom-friend. Where’s Charley?</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Out on the farm, hilling corn, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Poor fellow! how his corns must ache! and his back. Ha, ha,
ha! He works so hard to make a pleasure of what he does not enjoy. Nell,
tell him, if he comes in, I’ve run over to Mrs. Young’s to borrow her
pat. I won’t be gone long. <span class="exunt">[<i>Exit</i></span> <small>C.</small></p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> She saw him, but she doesn’t know him. If she only knew what he
received in exchange. Well, I’m not going to spoil a frolic for fear of
the consequences.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>outside</i>). Hang the corn, Careless; my back’s nearly broken
now.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <small>C.</small> <i>with a hoe, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos</span>.)</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> How about the onions, sir?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> How about them as much as you like, but no hoe about them for
me.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> They won’t be worth a cent.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Well, don’t get sentimental over them, Careless. They’re not
worth weeping over; no, Careless. I’ve set myself up for an independent
farmer, and there’s no clause regarding hoeing in my declaration of
independence. You shall have a holiday: you needn’t work to-day. You’re
not very fond of it at any time; but this day we have a visitor.</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> A visitor?<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Yes, Nelly. I’ve got word from him; he’s coming down for a
day’s sport. The very man I’ve picked out to lead you to the hymeneal
altar.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Gosh all hemlock!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> What’s the matter, Careless?</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Me&mdash;I&mdash;nothin’; only darned skeeter up my nose.</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Picked out for me? Thank you; I can do my own picking.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> And your own leading too. You’re smart enough to do the
leading business. Where’s Jenny, “the girl I left behind me”?</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> She left before you&mdash;came in. She ran over to Mrs. Young’s to
borrow her pat.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Her Pat? Haven’t I told her I wouldn’t have an Irishman on
the place?</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Ha, ha, ha! It’s a butter pat.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Ho, ho, ho!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> What’s the matter with you, Careless? (<i>Carlos looks sober.</i>)
Do that again, and you’ll get anything but a pat. Go, make yourself
presentable; put your auburn locks in curl-papers, and wash your face.
You shall guide my friend in his day’s sport.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Yes, sir. (<i>Aside</i>) He’s going to lead her with a halter, is
he? I’ll show him sport. <span class="exunt">[<i>Exit</i></span> <small>C.</small></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Yes, Nelly, we’re to have a visit from my old chum, Dixie
Dolby.</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Good gracious! he coming here?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Yes; for the first time; and to the country for the first
time, too. This little matrimonial scheme of mine is the only secret I
ever had from him.<a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a> He didn’t know I was courting Jenny Bobstay until he
received my wedding-cards. Wasn’t he surprised? No more than I, however.
Just a year ago, that highly respectable old mariner, Captain Boliver
Bobstay, mysteriously disappeared from Valparaiso, where the stanch bark
“Indigo Blue” was waiting for a cargo. His coat and hat were found upon
the pier; but the wearer never did appear upon that pier again.</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> And he was not heard of again?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> No. Yes. Six months ago, Jenny received a deed of this place
from Uncle Bobstay. How it came, or where it came from, nobody knew; but
it was found all right, and being a nice cosy place here, we married and
settled upon it three months ago.</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> But, Charley, your friend&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> O, yes; Dolby&mdash;clever fellow. You’ve never met him, Nelly?</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> No. I’ve often heard you speak of him, and feel inclined to
like him.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I know you will, Nelly. Now let’s have something nice for
dinner, in honor of our guest; something extra, you know.</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> I’ll look after the dinner. When he comes, we shall have
something <i>extra</i>. <span class="exunt">[<i>Exit</i></span> <small>R.</small></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> She’s a nice girl. I hope Dixie will like her. To think of
his coming down here to see me a married man. Why, I should almost as
soon expect, Uncle Bobstay to walk in at my door.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <small>C.</small> <span class="smcap">Bobstay</span>. <i>He has a black wig and black whiskers.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bobstay</i> (<i>at door</i>). Avast there! Are the decks, clear? Sh&mdash;<a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Hallo! Who have we here? Come in.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay</i> (<i>comes down</i> <small>R.</small>). All right, my hearty. When a messmate’s
going down in the briny&mdash;for the last time, mind&mdash;what do we do? Why, we
extends a helping hand, and grabs him by the hair of the head, don’t we?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> That is the first impulse&mdash;unless he’s bald.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay</i> (<i>extending hand</i>). Put it there; give us your flipper (<i>they
shake hands</i>). All right. Here’s your hand and ’ere’s my head! Take a
good hold of it, as if I was agoin’ down for the last time. Now, steady.
(<span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>takes hold of his wig, and</i> <span class="smcap">Bobstay</span> <i>seizes his beard</i>.) Let
fall all! (<i>He stands back, pulling off whiskers.</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>pulls off
wig</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Uncle Bobstay!</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Hush! Easy, Charley, easy. Bobstay of the Indigo Blue, he
went up&mdash;no, down&mdash;leastwise he went off. I’m a sperit, you understand?
I’m the Ancient Mariner&mdash;Captain Kyd&mdash;the Great Unknown&mdash;anything you
please but Bobstay. He mysteriously disappeared; let him be missed.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But what have you been doing? What’s the trouble?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> A deep one&mdash;deeper than the sea. Hush! Put it there (<i>shakes
hands</i>). There’s a woman at the bottom.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> At the bottom of the sea? Good gracious!</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> No. I wish she was, Charley. Put it there (<i>shakes hands</i>).
You’ve heard me speak of Spanker, skipper of the Venetian Red?<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Many a time. He was a particular friend of yours, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Charley, listen to a tale that would make the marines blush.
When I reached Valparaiso on my last run, I found the Venetian Red there
before me; but I found that Spanker had “mysteriously disappeared.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
His hat and coat were found upon the pier, and he was supposed to be
beneath the waves.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> A wink and finger on side of nose when these words are used
through the play.</p></div>

<p><i>Charles.</i> What a coincidence!</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Charley, he left a widow. I found her in Venetian Red on
board the mourning black,&mdash;no&mdash;in mourning red onboard the Venetian&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> No matter about the colors; go on.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Charley, she was in distress; and did you ever hear of a tar
who found a lass in distress, and deserted her? Never. In a week I had
asked her to marry me. In ten days we were married in church.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Married! Then you are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Mysteriously disappeared; that’s the p’int. We were married
in church. And now for an astonishing disclosure. When we came out of
church, who should I see but Spanker&mdash;the dead and gone Spanker&mdash;peeping
round a corner, with a grin on his face and a finger on his nose.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> What! Why, this is bigamy!</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> What-amy? ’Twas a swindle!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Unhappy man! How did you act? What did you say?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> I said nothing; put the lady, Mrs. Spanker Bobstay, into the
carriage, shut the door, and mysteriously disappeared.<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> And your wife?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Avast there! She’s Spanker’s wife.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But he basely deserted her.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> So did I. Mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But where have you been? What have you been doing all this
time?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Pursuing the phantom ship, Sylvester Spanker.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Have you any trace of him?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Trace, my hearty? He’s made a clean run, blast his toplights!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Then she is yours now.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Is she? That’s a p’int for the sharks to argue. I didn’t
marry his widow; I couldn’t marry his wife; and yet I’m a married man.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But you love her, captain?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Ease off a bit. If Spanker mysteriously disappeared, there’s
reason for Spanker’s disappearance. And as the aforesaid widow, when I
married her, who didn’t prove to be a widow after I married her, boxed
my ears twice afore the ceremony, the p’ints of my matrimonial compass
don’t p’int that way much.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But where is she?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> In chase of another craft, my boy. Close-reefed, to overhaul
a young spark, with a view to engage him. Shall I destroy his happiness?
That’s a p’int. Shall I appear like a spectre and forbid the banns?
That’s another p’int. No, my boy. I’ll set ... down here; keep under
water till she’s fairly hooked.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But suppose Spanker should turn up?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> That’s a p’int we can’t argue. Mum’s the<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a> word. I’m a spirit.
Bobstay’s gone up. Keep dark. Not a word to your wife now.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But Jenny don’t know you are here!</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> No? I’ll hide in the barn&mdash;in the pigsty&mdash;anywhere until the
widow’s hooked.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos</span>, <small>C.</small> <i>from</i> <small>L.</small>)</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Say, Mr. Cleverly, here’s a woman wants to see you. <span class="exunt">[<i>Exit</i></span> <small>C.</small>
<i>to</i> <small>R.</small></p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> A woman? Then I’ll get under hatches (<i>runs to table</i> <small>R.C.</small>
<i>and puts on wig and whiskers</i>). That used to be my state-room. I’ll
look it over. Mind, Charley, mum’s the word. I’m a spirit; mysteriously
disappeared. You understand? [<i>Exit door</i> <small>R.</small></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But I say, captain!&mdash;He’s pitched into Nelly’s room. No
matter. I’ll have him out as soon as I’ve finished with my visitor. Who
can she be?</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <small>C.</small>, <span class="smcap">Miss Persis Grievous</span>, <i>tragically</i>.)</p>

him from my loving presence; from me, the woman who adores him; for
what?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> A day’s sport, he says.</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> Sport! You are like the wicked boy, and I the innocent frog.
What’s sport to you is death to me. Last night he told me of his
proposed visit. This morning I found in his room beneath his pillow&mdash;for
we both lodge beneath the same roof; and I, in his absence, enter his
sanctum as a privileged guest of<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a> that dear and worthy Mrs. Sprygs, who
lets rooms at five dollars per week, lights included&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>aside</i>). For particulars, see small bills.</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i>&mdash;Beneath the pillow, which his ambrosial locks had pressed, I
found this note, and this picture (<i>shows photograph</i>). Do you recognize
it?</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>looks at photograph</i>). Good heavens! My wife!</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> Your wife? Then you, like me, are a victim. I blush for my
anger. Let us in each other’s arms mingle our tears (<i>approaching</i>
<span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>with arms extended</i>).</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>backing to</i> <small>R.</small>). Not just yet. Explain this, and at once.</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> Does it need explanation? Here is the picture, and here the
note signed Rosa Bean. A clandestine correspondence. I see it all, at
once. Under the pretext of a day’s sport, he comes here to make love to
your wife.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> The confounded scoundrel!</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> Speak gently of the erring. I love him. Yes, spite his faults,
I love him still. I am here to save him&mdash;to save you. I am a succoring
angel.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Give me that note (<i>takes note</i>). Not my wife’s handwriting;
evidently disguised. O, Jenny, Jenny, have I lost-you?</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> O, Dixie, Dixie, have I lost you?</p>

<p><i>Dolby</i> (<i>outside</i>). Hallo! Charley, old boy, where are you?</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> His voice. How it thr-r-r-ills me! But he must not see me
here. Where can I hide? (<i>Goes to<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a> door</i> <small>L.</small>) In this room? Get him away,
and I will return. Then we can make plans to circumvent them.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit door</i> <small>L.</small></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But, madam, that’s my wife’s room. She’s gone. Can I be
awake? My Jenny corresponding with my friend! And he in love? O, it’s
absurd!</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Dolby</span> <i>appears at door with a fishing-rod in case, a gun, and a
scoop-net with handle, clumsily held in his arms; a game-bag swung one
side, and a fishing-basket the other</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Ah, there you are, Charley. And here I am, armed and equipped
as the law directs. (<i>Attempts to enter; gun gets across the doorway.
Backs and tries again; net gets across the doorway. Business repeated.</i>)
Well, well, this is getting interesting (<i>enters</i>). Ah! here we are
(<i>drops everything on floor, and runs to</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span>, <i>hands extended</i>).
How are you, old fellow? Alive and kicking? Domestic bliss and rural
felicity? Happy chap!</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>shakes hands</i>). Glad to see you, Dixie. Welcome.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> That’s hearty. Where’s your wife? Must see her, you know. I
came to enjoy the beauties of the country, and you’ve the brightest and
loveliest. I know you know&mdash;of course you know.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>aside</i>). He knows, confound him! (<i>Aloud</i>) She’s out just
now. You shall see her.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Now let’s see&mdash;what shall we do first? There’s fishing,
hunting, and making love to a pretty girl. I’ve only a day, and we must
crowd lots of fun into ten hours.<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Well, what say you to lunch first?</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Nothing for me, save a glass of warm milk from the hands of a
dairymaid. I’ve come down here to breathe the country air. Stop a
moment. I forgot that (<i>runs up to door</i> <small>C.</small> <i>and stands breathing hard,
and striking his breast</i>). Ah, that’s the sort; the invigorating air of
the country. Ah! (<i>with a long breath</i>) there’s the first dose.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Nelly</span>, <small>R.</small> <span class="smcap">Dolby</span> <i>comes down</i> <small>L.</small>)</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> And here’s the dairymaid. My sister, Dixie. Mr. Dixon Dolby,
Nelly.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Ah, delightful (<i>bows</i>). What a pretty girl! What cheeks! What
a shape!</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Your first visit to the country, Mr. Dolby?</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> I’m ashamed to say it is, Miss Nelly. But it’s delightful; such
a quantity of trees and grass; houses not quite so plenty.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Mr. Dolby would like a glass of milk.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Yes, thank you; cow’s milk, if the cows are at leisure.</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> O, quite. I’ll bring it at once. <span class="exunt">[<i>Exit</i></span> <small>R.</small></p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Charley, my boy, your sister’s a perfect beauty.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Sit down, Dolby (<span class="smcap">Dolby</span> <i>brings chair up to table</i> <small>L.</small> <span class="smcap">Charles</span>
<i>brings one down from back; they sit</i> <small>R.</small> <i>and</i> <small>L.</small>) I had hopes that you
would come down here heart-whole; but I learn that you are already
engaged in a love affair.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Don’t mention it (<span class="smcap">Persis</span> <i>opens door, steps out, and listens</i>).
The most absurd thing; a little country-house flirtation with a lady old
enough to be my mother.<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a></p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> The wretch!</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Unfortunately, one evening I lay upon my bed, smoking and
reading, with my door open into the passage, on the farther side of
which is located the room of Miss Persis Grievous. Well, I dropped off
to sleep, the pipe dropped from my mouth, and I was awakened by the cry
of “fire,” and a brisk shaking from my female friend across the passage.
I had set fire to the bed, which was easily put out; not so the flame
which had been kindled in the breast of my fair but aged deliverer.</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> The heartless scoundrel!</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> From that time she has pursued me with a relentless love. I
cannot escape her.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> And you are engaged?</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Not exactly. Pegoty is willing, but Barkis is not; for,
Charley, I am in love with a phantom.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Then you’d better give up the ghost, and make Persis happy.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> No; I can never love but one, “Rosa Bean.” Isn’t that a pretty
name? I’ll show you her face (<i>hunts pockets</i>). Confound it, I’ve left
her photograph under my pillow!</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> O, the wretch! I’ll never forgive him&mdash;never&mdash;(<i>disappears
into room</i> <small>L.</small>).</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Nelly</span>, <small>R.</small> <i>with glass pitcher of milk and goblet</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Here’s the milk, Mr. Dolby.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> O, thank you (<i>she fills goblet, standing behind table.</i> <span class="smcap">Dolby</span>
<i>drinks</i>). Here’s your best health. Ah, what milk! I haven’t tasted
anything like that since I was&mdash;a very little child.<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a></p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Can I bring you anything else?</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> No, I’m obliged to you. By the way, is there a young lady in
the neighborhood named “Rosa Bean”?</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> “Bean”&mdash;“Bean”&mdash;No. There are no Beans here; there’s a Rosa
Higgins about half a mile from here.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> O, she won’t do.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> There are Rows of Beans in the garden; how will those suit,
Dixie? Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> To which I will introduce you at dinner. Good-bye till then.
<span class="exunt">[<i>Exit</i></span> <small>R.</small></p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Good-bye (<i>rises and puts back chair to</i> <small>L.</small> <span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>rises</i>).
Now, then, Charley, let’s try the fish (<i>takes his pole and net</i>).</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Really, Dixie, I cannot leave the house just now. I’ll tell
you what I’ll do. I’ll send my man with you, and join you soon (<i>goes to
door</i> <small>C.</small>). Here, Careless! Careless!</p>

<p><i>Carlos</i> (<i>enter</i> <small>C.</small>). Yes, sir. Here I am!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Careless, show this gentleman to the fishing-pond. (<i>Dolby at
back, busies himself with tackle.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Fishing-pond! Where’s that?</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>aside</i>). Shut up, you fool! Behind the barn.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Ho, ho, ho! that’s a pretty fishing-pond! Why, there’s nothin’
there ’cept skeeters!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Well, they bite, don’t they? You’d better take Towzer along
with you, he wants exercise.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Towzer? Why, he’s not sociable with strangers.<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Do as I bid you.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> All right, Mister. Come along, sir&mdash;I’ll show you sport!</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> That’s the sort.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> What kind of fishing do you like best? Do’nt make any
difference here. (<i>Aside</i>) Have to fish a darn long spell afore you get
any.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Well, s’pose we try for cod&mdash;no, I mean mackerel. Any blue-fish
about here?</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Ho, ho, ho!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Careless!</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Blue-fish? Wal, no; we’re out of blue-fish to-day. (<i>Aside</i>)
Lord, he <i>is</i> green!</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> No matter; lead me to the lake where sport the finny tribe.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Funny what? Gosh all hemlock! thought you was going a fishing!</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> O, come along, it’s getting late. Good-bye, Charley. Don’t
forget I must see your wife.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Exit</i> <small>C.</small></p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Say, Mister, who’s agoin’ to dig the bait, say? <span class="exunt">[<i>Exit</i></span> <small>C.</small></p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> At last he is gone, and we may arrange our plans.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>seizes him by arm and whirls him to</i> <small>R.</small>). What are you
about, captain? There’s a lady in that room.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> I must have a peep at her (<i>runs up and looks into keyhole</i>).
Ah, ha! ’tis she! (<i>falls back into</i> <span class="smcap">Charles’s</span> <i>arms</i>).</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> She! Who?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay</i> (<i>recovering himself</i>). Hush! Spanker’s wife! My widow, you
know! Our evil genius! It’s a judgment on me for giving up the search
for the lost Spanker. I must be off. Good-bye; put it there (<i>they shake

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>confused</i>). Yes&mdash;no&mdash;that is, I was afraid the cat would get
in there, and so I locked it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> I want to put my things away.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I wouldn’t take them off now, it’s a little chilly here.<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a></p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Chilly! Why, Charles, are you ill? How pale you look! If it
were anybody else, I should say a guilty look was on your face.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>aside</i>). A guilty look! and she in clandestine
correspondence with Dolby! (<i>Aloud</i>) Guilty? absurd! (<i>Aside</i>) What have
I done? Locked a woman in her room,&mdash;and I suspect her? O, here’s a
muddle!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Well, as you do not seem inclined to let me into my room, I
will lay off my things in Nelly’s (<i>goes to door</i> <small>R.</small>). Why, this is

<p><i>Charles.</i> O, yes, yes; I forgot to tell you. I&mdash;I locked up the dog in
there.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> The dog Towzer! What for?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Well, I was just going to sit down to read, and I didn’t want
to be disturbed.</p>

<p><i>Dog outside.</i> “Bow, wow, wow!”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Ah, Towzer seems to have found the way out.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I wish I could. (<i>Dog barks.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dolby</i> (<i>outside</i>). Help! murder! help! (<i>Comes tumbling in through the
window on to lounge; rolls on to floor.</i>) Confound that dog! (<i>gets up
rubbing his knees.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> What luck, Dolby. Did you get a bite?</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Yes; two of them; and if my legs hadn’t done good service, that
confounded dog would have made a meal of me (<i>still rubbing his knees,
not looking up.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Cleverly</span>, <i>down</i> <small>R.</small>).</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Sorry, Dolby, you didn’t have better luck. (<i>Aside</i>) Now to
test my wife (<i>steps</i> <small>C.</small>). Allow me to<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a> present you to my wife. Mrs.
Cleverly, my friend Dixon Dolby. Dixie, this is the lady you have longed
to meet.</p>

<p><i>Dolby</i> (<i>comes down</i> <i>L.</i>; <i>looks across</i>). Rosa Bean! Good gracious!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> No, no. My poor friend, you are growing crazy with your
absurd phantom, Rosa Bean.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Good gracious, it’s her! And I&mdash;I&mdash;unhappy wretch!&mdash;am in love
with Charley’s wife! What will become of me? I shall be found out
(<i>wipes face with handkerchief</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> I hope you are enjoying your day’s sport, Mr. Dolby.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> O, immensely! You see we took the dog along for a
photograph&mdash;no, for company. Don Carlos said we’d better; and he got
interested in my arrangements; and just as I stooped over to put on a
bait, somebody said, “St’boy!” and I suppose he mistook me for the
boy,&mdash;at any rate, took a bite. Then it suddenly occurred to me that
there was “no place like home.”</p>

<p><i>Dolby</i> (<i>takes gun</i>). All right. Don Carlos, we’ll try the game;

you.</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Say, what do you want to shoot?</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> How’s the deer?</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Deer? Ho, ho, ho! They’re purty well; but we’re out on ’em

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Well, a buffalo or two.</p>

gun; and if your game are as active as your friend Buffalo William, I’d
rather not be hunting, thank you.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Do you recognize that note, Dolby? (<i>Gives note.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> O, Lord, it’s! coming! Here’s a pretty day’s sport! That note?
O, yes. That note is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> From my wife, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> O, heavens, it’s all over! Charley, ’pon my word, I hadn’t the
least idea that Rosa Bean was your wife. If I had&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Silence! (<i>Snatches note from</i> <span class="smcap">Dolby</span>,<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a> <i>and runs to</i> <small>C.</small>) And
you, madam, what have you to say to it? (<i>Gives note to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span>)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Nelly</span>, <small>C.</small>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> (<i>looking at it.</i>) Say! What can I say? This in no way
concerns me.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Indeed! And the picture?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> O, the picture. (<i>Looks at it.</i>) Why, it’s our Nelly.</p>

<p><i>Charles and Dolby.</i> Our Nelly!</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Yes, our Nelly&mdash;who is answerable for all this mischief. She is
the writer of the note&mdash;the unknown correspondent of our friend Mr.
Dixon Dolby, Rosa Bean.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Well, that’s clever (<i>runs up to her</i>, <small>C.</small>). How do you do
(<i>shakes hands</i>). (<i>They go to lounge and sit talking.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> And you suspected me, Charley!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> What could I do? Your aunt Bobstay brought me your picture,
which somehow has mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay</i> (<i>jumping up</i>). “Mysteriously disappeared.” Hark! listen!
(<i>reads.</i>) “All friends of the supposed-to-be-drowned Sylvester Spanker,
especially his widow, are hereby notified that he has returned to his
ship, the Venetian Red, and will sail this day for Valparaiso.” Ha, ha!
ho, ho! He’s found, and I am free! Widow, I congratulate you.</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> Spanker alive! Thank fortune, I am no longer dependent on the
cold charities of the world!</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Madam, put it there (<i>they shake hands</i>). We’ll go aboard the
Venetian Red this very day. I’ll<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a> return property, and take my receipt,
tear up our certificate, give you my blessing, and mysteriously
disappear.</p>

<p><i>Dolby</i> (<i>comes down with</i> <span class="smcap">Nelly</span>). But what’s to become of me? Will you
desert the life you saved? Persis&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Persis.</i> Bother! You’d better be silent. I was in that room when you
told the story with such complimentary allusions to me.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> Ahem! Mum’s the word.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Come, Nelly, let’s have dinner. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Nelly</span> <small>L.</small>) This little
muddle is happily ended.</p>

<p><i>Dolby.</i> I’ve had my day’s sport; not just what I expected, but it’s
ending happily.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> The widow has found her husband.</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> For which we return thanks.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Carlos</span> <i>sticks his head in window</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Carlos.</i> Say, you’ll never see that calf again; she’s gin her last
blat.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Nelly</span>, <small>R.</small>)</p>

<p><i>Nelly.</i> Dinner’s ready.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>gives his wife his arm</i>, <small>C.</small>). Come, let’s to dinner. (<span class="smcap">Dolby</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Nelly</span> <i>arm in arm</i>, <small>R.</small>; <span class="smcap">Captain</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Persis</span> <i>arm in arm</i>,
<small>L.</small>) Are you ready, captain?</p>

<p><i>Bobstay.</i> Ay, ay, Charley, with a rousing appetite. So heave ahead;
we’ll follow in your wake. I’m happy. You are happy, widow. Yes, we’re
all happy&mdash;for we’ve had a day’s sport, and all our troubles
have&mdash;mysteriously disappeared.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
